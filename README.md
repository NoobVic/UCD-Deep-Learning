# UCD-Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning, using artificial neural networks as the architecture to learn the characteristics of data. This technique has been widely used in different research fields and computer vision is one of the most remarkable ones Bengio et al. (2012). Computer vision is to teach the machine how to "watch" and to do further image processing. One of its branches is to do image classification. Given a set of images that are each marked as only one category, then the machine is supposed to predict the category of a new set of test images and measure the accuracy of the prediction. In this project, I have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with adjusted parameters to predict whether there is pneumonia based on the chest X-ray image Mooney (2018). And I evaluate the model by its ROC curve and AUC value.
